A [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug#readme)-based logger with predefined methods and scope title, available in both browsers and Node.js.

## Install

```bash
npm install @gloxy/logger
# or
yarn add @gloxy/logger
# or
pnpm add @gloxy/logger
```

## Usage

### Enabling and Disabling

The only parameter `name` (e.g., 'myapp'), representing namespace, helps distinguish these logs from other prints.

- To enable the logger: `*` represents all log levels (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`).

  * In browser: `localStorage.logger = 'myapp:*'`
  * In Node.js: set the environment variable `LOGGER = myapp:* node index.js`

  Specify a level name to enable a single level of logger, e.g, `myapp:info`.

- Disable logger by removing it.

Or enable or disable the logger programmatically

```javascript
import { disable, enable } from '@gloxy/logger'

enable('myapp:*')
disable()
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Instantiate the logger at the beginning of your application.
import { createLogger } from '@gloxy/logger'
const logger = createLogger('myapp')

logger.info('Ball player %s is performing well', 'Mary')
// Outputs: colored `myapp:info Ball player Mary is performing well +0ms`.
```

### Title Scoped Logger

```javascript
// In addition to the basic usage, you can also create title-scoped logger, especially useful for module files

const log = logger('foo')
log.info('Ball player %s is performing well', 'Mary')
// Outputs: colored `myapp:info [foo] Ball player Mary is performing well +0ms`.
```
